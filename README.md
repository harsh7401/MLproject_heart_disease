# ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This machine learning project predicts the likelihood of heart disease in patients using real-world clinical data. It demonstrates a full ML pipeline: from data loading and cleaning, to exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## üìÅ Project File
MLproject_1.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook implementing:
